This package adds full typed coverage of the [Advanced Peripherals API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/advanced-peripherals) used to increase the functionality of [Computer Craft](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cc-tweaked) Computers.

**This package does not include types for the original Computer Craft API, but it does expose the methods needed to use Advaned Peripherals**

With there already being a few packages that add typings for the base Computer Craft API, I found myself searching for a package that would do the same for AP, since I couldn't find any, I made one myself :)

# Usage

- Install the package using your preferred package manager

        npm i -D advanced-peripheral-types

- Include the package in your `tsconfig.json` to have access to the global types

```json
    "types": ["advanced-peripheral-types"]
```
